This project is my first attempt at implementing what I have learnt about 
HTML and CSS. The aim of the project was to mimic the Google home page. I 
managed to do this by creating both a navigation bar and footer as well as placing 
the Google logo in the center of the page with a search bar and buttons below it.
This was a great opportunity to finally display what I can do, although it is not
perfect it was a great learning exercise and focused what I need to go over again
learn. 
The use of browsers dev tools was also very useful and learning what needs to be
done or changed when reviewing the code was very beneficial.
